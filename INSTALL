django-fest

First, you need to install "V8" and "PyV8" libraries:

    export V8_SVN_URL="http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.7/"
    pip install svn+http://pyv8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/@429#egg=PyV8

Next, update fest javascript libs from fest repository:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Next, install django-fest by runing the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included "fest"
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
git checkout.

You also need 'fest' JavaScript lib in your 'static' dir.
